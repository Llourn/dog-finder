# Dog finder

## Description

This app was created to provide a user access to search for adoptable dogs with the ability to see their location. The user is able to search for and display dogs based on characteristics like breed, size, gender, etc. It uses the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/#api-calls) and the [Google maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/).

Once you arrive at the landing page you'll be greeted by an army of puppies along with a button to access a form to enter all the criteria for your search. Fill in as many or as few fields as you'd like to search, and if you need to tweak the parameters of your search just click `Back` in your browser and your form will retain the values from your last search.

With any luck we'll find some elligible canines for you to browse and should any of them catch your eye simply click the button on the card to retrieve more information. Should you wish to adopt, just click the link at the bottom of the page and you'll be directed to PetFinder.com to complete the process. At any time you can click the home button in the nav bar to take you back to the landing page.

## Features

Some feature of this website are:

- Find lovable cuddle-monsters to claim as your own!
- There are numerous search parameters to choose from to help you narrow down your search to that perfect dog.
- Had to expand your search to a location further away? No problem! Google maps will display the location of the prospective adoptee so you can plan that road trip.

## Wishlist

Things that we would like to add in a future update would be:

- More animals! Cats, rabbits, chinchillas, bearded dragons... etc.
- Implement search by organization.
